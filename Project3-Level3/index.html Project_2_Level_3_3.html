<div class="one">A <h1>free</h1> bird leaps
on the back of the wind  
 
and floats downstream   
till the current ends

and dips his wing
in the orange sun rays

and dares to claim the sky.


<br>

<div class="two">The <h1>free</h1> bird thinks of another breeze

and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn

and he names the sky his own

<div class="three">But a <h3>caged</h3> bird stands on the grave of dreams   

his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied  
 
so he opens his throat to sing.

</div>

<div class="four">The <h3>caged</h3> bird sings   

with a fearful trill   
of things unknown 
  
but longed for still   

and his tune is heard   
on the distant hill  
 
for the caged bird  
 
sings of <h1>freedom<h1>.
